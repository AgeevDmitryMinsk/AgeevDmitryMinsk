### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Dmitry.
I'm Front-end developer since 2020.
I'm responsible, motivated, easy-to-learn Frontend Developer.
I like programming because it's interesting for me to see the result of the work I've done and to make user interface live and friendly.
I am currently looking for a job as a Front-end developer.
I will be glad to share my experience and learn from other developers.
